# Daily Catchup

The org-wide daily engineering report pipeline (`.github/workflows/daily-catchup.yml`):
discover active repos → summarise each with Codex → merge into one daily file → commit it
to the `catchup` repo and email a styled report.

## Language

**Catchup**:
The daily pipeline (and the `Lascade-Co/catchup` data repo) that captures the org's last 24h
of engineering activity.
_Avoid_: digest, standup.

**Daily file**:
The merged `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.json` — one entry per active repo with its developers, bullets,
and enrichment. The single source the commit and email steps both consume.
_Avoid_: report (that's the email), summary (that's per-repo).

**Per-repo summary**:
One repo's `summary-*.json` artifact: developers with Codex bullets plus enrichment.
Produced by the `summarize` matrix job.

**Enrichment**:
The non-commit signals attached to each repo summary — merged **PRs**, active **branches**,
the in-window release **version** tag, and the repo's **tags**. All best-effort.

**Status**:
A commit's delivery state, decided deterministically from branch/PR state in the per-repo
step (never by Codex): **Published** (reachable from the default branch), **Testing** (on a
branch with an open PR), **Work in Progress** (on a branch with no PR). Bullets are grouped
by status, and these are the email's section headings.
_Avoid_: Shipped, In Progress (earlier freeform names — superseded by these three)._

**Exclude list**:
`data/catchup_exclude.txt` — owner/repo names omitted from the daily email (one per line,
`#` comments allowed). A repo is **included by default**; add it here to opt out. Excluded
repos are still summarised and committed to the daily file. Seeded from repos lacking the
`catchup-mail` topic, then maintained by hand — the runtime no longer reads topics.

**Active repo**:
A repo with non-bot commits in the look-back window — the only repos that get summarised and
appear in the daily file. (There is no "inactive" list in the email.)

**Report JSON**:
The email's intermediate `report.json` — Codex prose (executive summary, display names,
patterns) merged with authoritative numbers and the deterministic **status** sections. The
renderer turns it into the HTML email.

**Authoritative**:
A value not trusted from Codex — computed from git/GitHub (commit counts, contributor list,
PR count, version, branches, stats) or derived deterministically (the **status** split).
Codex supplies prose only (bullets, executive summary, display names, patterns).

## Relationships

- The **discover** job lists **active repos**; **summarize** turns each into a **per-repo
  summary** with **enrichment**.
- **collect** merges all per-repo summaries into the one **daily file**.
- **commit** publishes the daily file to the **catchup** repo; **email** drops repos in the
  **exclude list**, builds the **report JSON**, and sends it. commit and email run in parallel.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "How do I keep a noisy repo out of the email?"
> **Maintainer:** "Add it to data/catchup_exclude.txt. It's still summarised and committed
> to the daily file — it just won't show up in the *email*."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "summary" meant both the per-repo artifact and the emailed report — resolved: **per-repo
  summary** is the artifact, **report JSON** / email is the org-wide output.
